# Anatoly's LaTeX Templates

I intend this to be my "base" repository for working with LaTeX documents.
This is mostly for personal use, but others might find it useful.


## What's included

- VS Code configuration files

- My personal bibliography

- (TODO) Russian language support

- (TODO) Proper style template
